# Survey for Personal Website

This is a simple survey form that I made using html/css only as part of the FreeCodeCamp frontend certification. The intention of this project was just to design the front end aspect of the survey. As such, whatever data
is submitted at the end of the form is not sent anywhere. 

# How to run

Simply clone the repository and open up the `index.html` file on your preferred Web browser or just follow this link to see the [live preview](https://jonathanbernal.github.io/personal-website-survey-form/).
